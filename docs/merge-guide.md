# Applying updates from the assistant

When you open the pull request generated by the assistant you might see merge conflicts if your live branch already contains manual edits that overlap with the assistant's changes. The safest way to accept the assistant's update is to create a dedicated branch locally, apply the patch there, and resolve any conflicts with a clear preference for the version you want to keep.

## Recommended workflow

1. **Fetch the assistant branch**
   ```bash
   git fetch origin <assistant-branch>
   ```
2. **Create a local integration branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b integrate-assistant
   ```
3. **Merge the assistant branch**
   ```bash
   git merge --no-ff origin/<assistant-branch>
   ```
4. **Resolve conflicts**
   * Use your editor to inspect the conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`/`=======`/`>>>>>>>`).
   * For files you have not touched locally, you can usually keep the assistant version by choosing the "incoming" or "theirs" side.
   * For files with local edits you want to retain, merge the relevant portions manually and remove the conflict markers.
5. **Run the app/tests** to make sure everything still works.
6. **Commit the merge** and push the integration branch to your remote.
7. **Open a PR from the integration branch** into your deployment branch (e.g., `main`).

## Tips

- Avoid using the "Accept All Current Changes" button unless you are certain you want to discard the assistant's version.
- If you only want the assistant's version for a conflicting file, a quick way is:
  ```bash
  git checkout --theirs path/to/conflicting-file
  ```
  then re-open the file to verify before committing.
- After resolving conflicts, run `git status` to double-check that no `<<<<<<<` markers remain before committing.

Following these steps ensures you keep control over which changes land in production while still benefiting from the assistant's updates.
